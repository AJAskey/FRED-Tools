# FRED Tools
 Interface with Tools into FRED Economic Data Online Library - [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org)
 
 Main tools are in the net.ajaskey.market.tools.fred.executables package. These tools are works in-progress at this point.
 
 Previous iterations are in the net.ajaskey.market.tools.fred.legacy package. Viewers may find some insights into the FRED API and logic. This package has been deprecated.
 
 Users will need to obtain an API Key from FRED - [API Key](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html) - The key is free and is used by the FRED server to monitor activity.
 
 I store my key in a Windows environment variable **FRED_APIKEY**. See class **ApiKey** for use.

 I am working on it.
